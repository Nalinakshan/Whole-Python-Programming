## 📜 About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Python masterclass archive. This repository serves as a comprehensive reference guide for my journey in mastering Python programming—from the absolute basics to advanced concepts like Multiprocessing and GUI development.

**Key Feature:**
The entire source code is deliberately **commented out**. This allows me to use this single file as a massive reference library without code blocks clashing or executing simultaneously.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Python-Learning-Journey.git

```


2. **Open the file:** Navigate to the main Python script.
3. **Activate a Section:**
* Find the topic you want to study (e.g., `# WHILE (LOOP)`).
* **Uncomment** (remove the `#`) only the lines within that specific block.
* Run the script to see the output.


4. **Re-comment:** Once finished, comment the lines back out to keep the file clean for the next session.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Topics Covered

This file is organized logically, progressing from syntax basics to complex engineering concepts.

### 🟢 Level 1: The Foundation

* **Variables & Data Types:** Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans.
* **Type Casting:** Converting between `int`, `float`, and `str`.
* **String Manipulation:** Slicing `[start:stop:step]`, Indexing, and Formatting.
* **Math Operations:** Basic arithmetic and the `math` module.

### 🟡 Level 2: Control Flow & Logic

* **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `elif`, `else`.
* **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`.
* **Loops:**
* `while` loops (and input validation).
* `for` loops (range, iterables).
* Nested loops.


* **Flow Control:** `break`, `continue`, `pass`.

### 🟠 Level 3: Data Structures

* **Lists:** 1D and 2D lists (Matrices), methods (`append`, `pop`, `sort`).
* **Tuples:** Immutable collections.
* **Sets:** Unique collections and set operations (Union, Intersection).
* **Dictionaries:** Key-Value pairs and Dictionary Comprehensions.

### 🔵 Level 4: Functions & Modularity

* **Defining Functions:** Parameters and Return statements.
* **Arguments:** Keyword arguments, `*args` (tuples), `**kwargs` (dictionaries).
* **Scope:** Local vs. Global variables (`LEGB` rule).
* **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions.
* **Higher-Order Functions:** `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and assigning functions to variables.

### 🟣 Level 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* **Classes & Objects:** Attributes, Methods, and `__init__`.
* **Inheritance:**
* Single Inheritance.
* Multi-level Inheritance.
* Multiple Inheritance.


* **Polymorphism:** Method Overriding and Duck Typing.
* **Encapsulation & Abstraction:** Abstract Classes (`ABC`).
* **Super Function:** `super()`.

### 🔴 Level 6: Advanced Concepts

* **File Handling:** Reading, Writing, Copying, Moving, and Deleting files using `os` and `shutil`.
* **Exception Handling:** `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks.
* **Modules:** Importing custom and built-in modules.
* **Concurrency:**
* **Threading:** Running tasks concurrently (Daemon threads).
* **Multiprocessing:** Parallel execution using multiple CPU cores.


* **Walrus Operator:** `:=` (Assignment Expression).

### 🖥️ Bonus: GUI Development

* **Tkinter:** Basic window creation, labels, and geometry management.
